Ion yields measured from the two-entity inclusion extracted from the chemical depth profile. Color groupings identifies elements with high affinity (i.e., CH-rich kerogen and silicate chert. Molecular ions loosely connected on the sides identifies the plasma chemistry byproducts originated on the way to the detector. Second image - decision borderlines on PCA reduced spectra.

### TL;DR

In this paper we present:

- weighted mass correlation networks (WMCN) identified for inclusions in the bulk of the analyte material
- sliding window centrality measure and a divergence of the modularity score on spots with more that one chemical entities present
- kernel density estimation on ion-intensity regions for specific compounds
- Van-Krevelen metric for organic vs. inorganic materials
- PCA scores and loadings for chemical compounds identified in the sample
- We performed a competitive test of 25 supervised machine learning models to achieve a 99% accuracy rates for identification of investigated materials (bio-organic Precambrian kerogen vs. inorganic host mineral)
