Have you ever wondered how low in the abundance a substance should be to pass unregistered with modern analytical instruments? In this paper we show that this number can be ridiculously low. To be precise - in the femtomole/mm<sup>-2</sup> range - which is a billionth of a millionth (10<sup>-15</sup>) of a mole (however, it's still quite a lot of molecules!)

### [Paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-66240-1) / [PDF](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-66240-1.pdf)

### TL;DR

In this paper we present:

- a description of a novel analytical technique for the detection of extremely low concentrations of amino acids called ORIGIN, a compact and lightweight laser desorption ionization – mass spectrometer designed and developed for in situ space exploration missions.
- a detection limit of a few fmol mm−2, and the possibility for sub-fmol detection sensitivity, this measurement technique excels current space exploration systems by three orders of magnitude.
- demonstrate that ORIGIN is a promising instrument for the detection of signatures of life and ready for upcoming space missions, such as the Europa Lander
