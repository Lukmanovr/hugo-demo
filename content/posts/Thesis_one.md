A humble reminder that something very complex from up-close, can be a lot simpler from other perspectives. This image describes a structural organization of chemical signals measured from quartz (SiO<sub>2</sub>) mineral

### TL;DR

In my dissertation I write about:

- a novel, highly miniature mass-spectrometer designed and developed for operations in space (e.g., Moon, Mars, Europa)
- Main results are divided in two groups: 1) Hardware modifications and 2) Computational approaches
- Utilizing the new laser system I improved the signal-to-noise ratio of the signal by 10 fold, same goes to the resolution of the mass spectra (10X).
- Further, as high-quality signal acquisition was ensured, i focused on computational methods to improve the signal even more, getting last bits of improvements.
