### TL;DR

The thesis describes ways of improving the signal quality of the novel, highly miniature mass-spectrometer designed and developed for operations in space (e.g., Moon, Mars, Europa). The improvements include hardware
modifications and modern computational approaches, and summarizes future development directions. The results section is presented with 7 peer-reviewed publications.

- Main results are divided in two groups: 1) Hardware modifications and 2) Computational approaches
- Utilizing the new fs-laser system I've improved the signal-to-noise ratio of the signal by ~10 fold, with comparable improvements to the resolution (m/dm) of the mass spectra (~7-8X) by implementing the far-UV fs ion source.
- Further, as high-quality signal acquisition was ensured, utilizing machine learning methods I've built the analysis pipeline that allows to discover and characterize chemical compounds from un-ordered spectral libraries.
