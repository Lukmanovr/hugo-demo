### TL;DR

The thesis describes ways of improving signal quality of the novel, highly miniature mass-spectrometer designed and developed for operations in space (e.g., Moon, Mars, Europa). The improvements include hardware
modifications, implementation of various computational approaches for better signal recovery, and summarizes future development directions. The results section is presented with 7 peer-reviewed publications, covering different aspects of ion generation, signal processing and data exploration using graph-networks and ML (see [publications](/publications/) for a full list of published articles).
