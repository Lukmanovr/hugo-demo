#### ABOUT

> **Rustam A. Lukmanov / 08.09.1992** 

I regard myself as an orderly, cooperative and curious person. I have a diverse background in analytical techniques and computational methods, that I believe are applicable and transferable for a wide range of problems. Interested in progress and building things. I've got the "Shaper" archetype from Ray Dalio's test on [PrinciplesYou](https://principlesyou.com/). Have an open-minded approach to life and positive attitude towards future.
