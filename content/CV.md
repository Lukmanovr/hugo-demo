#### ABOUT

> **Rustam A. Lukmanov / 08.09.1992 / Male / Citizenship – Russian**

I regard myself as an orderly, cooperative and curious person. I have a diverse technical background in analytical techniques and scientific computational methods, that I believe are applicable and transferable for a wide range of problems. Interested in progress and building things. I've got the "Shaper" archetype from Ray Dalio's test on [PrinciplesYou](https://principlesyou.com/). Developing an entrepreneurial skills/ideas. Have an open-minded approach to life and positive attitude towards future.
